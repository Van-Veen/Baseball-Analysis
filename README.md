# Baseball-Analysis
Beginner level exploration of baseball data, analysis, and modelling with R.

## This project reflects the following objectives
1. Working through 'Analyzing Baseball Data with R' by Jim Albert and Max Marchi (current)
2. Creating a shiny app that works as a query system to look up player or team performance... more on this later.
