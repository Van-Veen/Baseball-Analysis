10:  B    9 : These are balks, and the pitch result is always 'N'. Baserunners advance one base each.

11:  C   20 : These are for baserunners who are caught attempting a steal

12:  D  246 : There are three potential things here. Simply, D represents a double by the batter with the fielding
			  positions specified. These are also double ground rules (DGR) and defensive indifference (DI). I've
			  read that DI is when there is no attempt to prevent a stolen base and will have the base advancements
			  specified after the dot. I need to read more about what a ground double rule is.

13:  E   49 : These are errors with the field position specified after (E). 

14:  F   13 : These are either a Fielder's Choice(FC) or an error on foul ball (FLE). Need to research

15:  H  223 : These are either hit by pitch (HP) or home runs (HR)

16:  I   43 : These are clearly Intentiional Walks. Every instance has I in pitch result and IW in play result. 
			  However, there may be additional base info for existing baserunners

17:  K 1414 : These are strikes (K) and strike + event (K+). Need to create an algorithm for action based on presence
			  and decoding of K+ events

18:  O    5 : These are trickier. OA is an advance by baserunner that may not be described by an existing code and
			  are usually followed by a comment. Need to further examine these and the associated 'com' items in
			  our source data.

19:  P   29 : There are a couple of things here. P0x is a pick off, or failed pick off. PB is a passed ball, akin
			  to wild pitch, that allows a baserunner, or baserunners, to advance. There is also POCSx, which
			  signifies a pick off in which the baserunner is categorized as caught stealing.
			  
20:  S  888 : Things that start with 'S' are mostly singles, with the fielding sequence following. There are also
			  items that are coded as 'SB' which are stolen bases
			  
21:  T   13 : These are triples

22:  W  479 : These are either walks (W), wild pitches (WP), or a combination of both (W+WP). For the last item,
			  it may be possible that existing baserunners at the time of the event may advance more than one plate
